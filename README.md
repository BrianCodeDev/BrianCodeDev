Hi there! 👋

I’m a Software Engineer with 4+ years of self-taught experience specializing in WordPress development, custom themes and plugins, and full-stack web solutions. I’m passionate about solving real-world problems with clean, maintainable code and delivering exceptional user experiences.

I love building custom WordPress solutions that are scalable, performance-optimized, and easy to maintain. Beyond WordPress, I enjoy working with PHP, JavaScript (React), AWS, and CI/CD pipelines to deliver reliable, modern web applications.

I’m committed to continuous learning, contributing to open source, and staying up-to-date with the latest in web development. I believe in sharing knowledge and collaborating with other developers to make the web a better place.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me with a strong cup of coffee in hand ☕️, planning my next project, or exploring new tech to level up my skills.
