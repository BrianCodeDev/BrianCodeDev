During my free time, I actively contribute to open-source projects on GitHub. Due to my significant contributions to DuckDuckGo, I was appointed as a maintainer and community leader with write access to all of DuckDuckGo's repositories. I have also made contributions to a variety of other open-source projects and organizations, including Mozilla, Angular, Svelte, Node.JS etc
  
I also maintain and contribute to a lot of community open-source projects and libraries. Some of the communities includes [Tinkerhub Foundation](https://tinkerhub.org/), [Kites Foundation](https://kitesfoundation.org/), [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/), [Patternfly](https://www.patternfly.org/) etc. I strongly believe that the true value of open-source is not just the code, it's the community around it.

You can read more about me and my open source journey at my website: [https://www.gautamkrishnar.com/](https://www.gautamkrishnar.com/)

I create most of my open-source projects to solve the challenges I encounter in life, with many more still waiting to be addressed. I am embarking on a quest to find solutions for each one, one problem at a time.
