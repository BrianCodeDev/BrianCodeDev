# 👋 Hi
there!

Welcome to my development space! I’m a **Software Engineer** with 4+ years of self-taught experience specializing in **WordPress development**, custom themes and plugins, and full-stack web solutions.  

I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with clean, maintainable code and delivering exceptional user experiences. I love building custom WordPress solutions that are **scalable**, **performance-optimized**, and **easy to maintain**.  

Beyond WordPress, I enjoy working with **PHP**, **JavaScript (React)**, **AWS**, and **CI/CD pipelines** to deliver reliable, modern web applications.  

I’m committed to **continuous learning**, contributing to **open source**, and staying up-to-date with the latest in web development. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me with a strong cup of coffee in hand ☕️, planning my next project, or exploring new tech to level up my skills.
