Im a Website Developer, Software Engineer, and Developer Creator who builds scalable, production-ready web applications with a strong focus on performance, usability, and long-term maintainability.

I’ve been self-taught for 4+ years, learning by building real projects, breaking things, fixing them, and shipping solutions that actually get used. My work sits at the intersection of clean engineering, creative problem-solving, and practical business needs.

My primary specialization is custom WordPress development, but I don’t treat WordPress as a page builder — I treat it as a framework. I build custom themes, plugins, APIs, and integrations that are fast, secure, and easy to extend. Everything I create is designed with scalability and developer experience in mind.

Beyond WordPress, I work across the full stack, using PHP, JavaScript, React, and cloud tooling like AWS, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines to deploy modern web systems. I enjoy architecting systems that are not only functional today, but still clean and flexible months or years down the road.

As a developer creator, I actively build tools, platforms, and experiments—often open-source or community-focused—that help other developers and creators move faster. I’m constantly learning, refactoring, and improving how I write code and how I design systems.

🧠 How I Think About Development

Performance is a feature, not an afterthought

Readable code > clever code

Build for humans first, browsers second

Ship early, improve often

Automate anything repetitive
